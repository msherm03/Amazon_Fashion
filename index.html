      <p> A few extra dollars haven’t stopped shoppers from clicking “add to cart.” Fashion purchases on Amazon have skyrocketed post-pandemic, cementing the platform’s growing influence in the retail world while raising expert concerns about the environmental cost of fast, low-priced fashion. </p>

      <p> In March 2021, Amazon held a market share of about <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/524853/amazon-fashion-market-share-usa/"> 12% </a> of all U.S. apparel sales. By 2023 — as the nation fully emerged from the pandemic — its share had tripled, making it the leading U.S. e-commerce retailer with nearly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/274255/market-share-of-the-leading-retailers-in-us-e-commerce/"> 40% </a> of the market. </p>

      <p> Alongside Amazon’s growing market share, the environmental toll of fast fashion has intensified, fueled by the disposable nature of cheap garments. </p>

      <p> The fashion industry is currently responsible for about <a href="https://earth.org/fast-fashions-detrimental-effect-on-the-environment/"> 10% </a> of global carbon emissions — more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined. Amazon is a part of that footprint, offering inexpensive apparel that often has a short lifespan. </p>

      <p> “I think sustainability is something people say they care about but they’re spending patterns have a different story,” said Diana Pearl, senior news and features editor at The Business of Fashion. </p>

      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Media_Lab"> MIT Media Lab’s </a> Alex Berke et al. compiled an Amazon data set, representing a first-of-its-kind collection containing detailed purchase histories from roughly 5,000 Amazon.com consumers, spanning 2018 through 2022. </p>

<br> 


    <div class= "wrapper1"> 

      <p> Out of 10 style categories, “Apparel” saw the most significant positive impact following the pandemic. In 2018, consumers purchased almost 180 apparel items — and that number more than doubled four years later. <br> <br>

      Apparel includes everything from loungewear and shapewear to beachwear coverups and yoga pants. </p>

      <p> Elizabeth Robinson, an Amazon fashion influencer and creator, was impacted by this surge. Her core audience — mostly Gen Z consumers — searches for unique, trendy pieces without spending much money. <br> <br>

      "Lower price ranges, like $10-$40, convert the most,” she said. “Either you’re buying a few things at once or it's kind of an impulse purchase.” 
        
      </p>

      <p> Apparel was one of four style categories, including earrings, necklaces, bracelets and anklets and base layer sets (representing long underwear), that experienced the largest growth in average purchase price per unit from 2018 to 2022. The average price for an apparel item rose from $17 to $22, a $5 increase, not adjusted for inflation. <br> <br>

      Interestingly, apparel was one of the few sectors that saw prices fall during the pandemic. According to <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/business-features/feature/in-fashion-inflation-walmart-apparel-retail-supply-chain-prices-1235015662/"> Women’s Wear Daily,</a> as of December 2021, apparel prices were down 0.4%, including around a 5% drop in women’s apparel. <br> <br>

      Thus, as prices dropped, consumption increased — meaning consumers bought more to reach the total apparel sales of close to $8,000 in 2022. </p>

      <p> Now, Amazon is capitalizing on a new wave of <a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/story/sustainability/amazon-confirms-fashion-hauls-arent-going-anywhere/"> "haul" culture,</a> where shoppers binge order clothing just to create social media content using the trending hashtag #AmazonFashion.</p>

      <p> Robinson, who relies on TikTok to promote her Amazon finds, has conflicting opinions about the Amazon fashion trend. </p>

      <p> “The rise of Amazon fashion is great, but I think it's such a niche of people who are bargaining on a budget,” said Robinson. “It's a waste. Why would you spend $10 on a shirt to spend $10 again? I’ve thrown out most of my Amazon stuff at this point.” </p>

      <p> Pearl agrees. “There is something to the whole ‘Oh, I got it on Amazon,’” she said. “People shop on Amazon to save money. It's about costs, because there are lots of ways to buy clothes conveniently.” </p>

      <p> So what happens to all the low-quality Amazon apparel that gets thrown away? </p>

      <p> Each year, about <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fast-fashion-environmental-impact-pollution-emissions-waste-water-2019-10#thats-because-both-the-jeans-and-the-shirt-are-made-from-a-highly-water-intensive-plant-cotton-17"> 85% </a> of all textiles end up in landfills, and the equivalent of one garbage truck of clothes is burned or dumped every second. Textile waste takes decades to decompose, producing greenhouse gas emissions, like methane, in the process. </p>

      <p> Additionally, about <a href="https://marinedebris.noaa.gov/interagency-marine-debris-coordinating-committee-reports/interagency-marine-debris-coordinating-committee-report-microfiber-pollution"> 60% </a> of textiles contain microplastics, which can accumulate in the soil and groundwater as fabrics disintegrate. </p>

      <p> Amazon offers ABIS apparel: brands focused on sustainable and responsibly sourced clothing, often using materials such as organic cotton to combat climate change. From 2018 to 2022, however, only two ABIS apparel products appeared in the data set. </p>

      <p> Shoppers can participate in Amazon fashion responsibly. Buying intentionally by choosing items that meet a genuine need, supporting ABIS or other ethically made apparel even at higher prices and donating, reselling or repurposing clothing instead of discarding it can all make a difference. </p>

      <p> The environmental impact of each Amazon apparel purchase is becoming harder to ignore. As online shopping evolves, the trade-off between costs and quality could define what the future of Amazon fashion — and our planet — looks like.  </p>
